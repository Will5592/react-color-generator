# react-color-generator

This is a random color generator, that makes use of the https://www.thecolorapi.com/.

Made using React, this is the same project as my vanilla generator, rebuilt in React.

The only difference is a header.

Note: This was my first React project, and does not make use of Reacts component based structure. I have used this with my Budget Tracker project, also included in my GH account.
